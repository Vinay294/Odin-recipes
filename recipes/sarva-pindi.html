    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of rice flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of chana dal (split Bengal gram)</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3-4 green chilies, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of fresh coriander leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tsp of cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 tsp of sesame seeds</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak chana dal for 3-4 hours and grind it into a coarse paste: <br>
            Rinse 1/2 cup of chana dal (split Bengal gram) and soak it in water for about 3-4 hours. Drain the soaked chana dal and grind it into a coarse paste using a mixer grinder or food processor. Do not add water while grinding.</li>
        <li>Mix rice flour, chana dal paste, onions, green chilies, coriander leaves, cumin seeds, sesame seeds, and salt to taste in a large mixing bowl: <br>
            In a large mixing bowl, add 2 cups of rice flour, the ground chana dal paste, 1 finely chopped onion, 3-4 finely chopped green chilies, 1/4 cup of chopped fresh coriander leaves, 1 tsp of cumin seeds, 1 tsp of sesame seeds, and salt to taste. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Knead the mixture into a firm dough by adding water gradually: <br>
            Add water little by little and knead the mixture into a smooth dough. The dough should be firm, but not too hard or too soft.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into small portions and flatten them into disc shapes: <br>
            Divide the dough into small portions and shape them into small balls. Take a ball of the dough and press it between your palms to flatten it into a disc shape.</li>
        <li>Cook the flattened dough on a heated pan or griddle, drizzle oil, and flip to cook both sides until golden brown: <br>
            Heat a flat pan or griddle over medium heat. Place the flattened dough onto the heated pan and gently press it with your fingers to make it thin and even. Make 2-3 small holes in the center of the dough to ensure even cooking. Drizzle a little oil on top of the dough and around the edges. Cook the sarva pindi on medium heat for 4-5 minutes on one side or until it turns golden brown. Flip the sarva pindi and cook it on the other side for another 4-5 minutes or until it turns golden brown.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process with remaining dough portions: <br>
            Remove the cooked sarva pindi from the pan and transfer it to a plate. Repeat the process with the remaining dough portions.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with chutney or curry of your choice: <br>
            Serve the hot and crispy sarva pindi with any chutney or curry of your choice. Enjoy!</li>
