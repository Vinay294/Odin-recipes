    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup Parboiled Rice (idli-dosa rice)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup Regular Rice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Whole Urad Dal (without skin) or Split Urad Dal (black lentils)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon Fenugreek Seeds (methi dana)</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon Chana Dal (gram lentils), optional</li>
        <li>Water, as needed</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Oil, for shallow frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the rice and urad dal separately for at least 6 hours, along with fenugreek seeds in the same container as urad dal.</li>

        <li>Drain the water from the soaked urad dal and grind it in a wet grinder or mixer grinder until it becomes a smooth and fluffy batter. This process takes around 10-15 minutes. Add little water as required to make it into a smooth batter.</li>

        <li>Take the urad dal batter in a bowl and keep it aside.</li>

        <li>Now, grind the soaked rice into a smooth batter. It should have a slightly coarse texture. Add water as required to make it into a smooth batter.</li>

        <li>Mix the rice batter with the urad dal batter, add salt to taste and mix well. The consistency of the batter should be slightly thick, like pancake batter.</li>

        <li>Cover the batter with a lid and allow it to ferment overnight or for at least 8 hours in a warm place. The batter should double in size and have a sour smell. If it is not fermenting, you can keep it in a warm place or place it in an oven with the light on for a few hours to aid the fermentation.</li>

        <li>After fermentation, give the batter a good mix.</li>

        <li>Heat a dosa tawa or non-stick pan over medium-high heat.</li>

        <li>Once the tawa is hot, sprinkle some water on it. If the water sizzles and evaporates immediately, the tawa is ready for use.</li>

        <li>Using a ladle, pour a ladle full of batter on the center of the tawa and spread it in a circular motion to make a thin crepe-like layer. You can make it as thin or thick as you like.</li>
        
        <li>Drizzle some oil around the edges and center of the dosa.</li>

        <li>Cook the dosa on medium-high heat for 1-2 minutes or until the bottom turns golden brown and crisp.</li>

        <li>Flip the dosa using a spatula and cook the other side for 30 seconds to a minute or until it is cooked and crispy.</li>

        <li>Serve hot with coconut chutney, sambar or any other side dish of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
